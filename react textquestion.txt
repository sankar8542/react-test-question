      Real DOM is what you see on your browser screen and virtual DOM is copy of it. The main difference is that when you make changes in any part of real DOM, 
     It re-renders the whole DOM at once and that affects efficiency of your server loading cause it has to reload the whole page as browser can only read JS, Html/CSS.

      The word “props” implies “properties”, and its working functionality is quite similar to HTML attributes. Basically, these props components are read-only components. In ReactJS, 
      the data can be passed from one component to another component using these props, similar to how the arguments are passed in a function.
